# autotask_ruby
WIP - a Ruby client for interacting with the Autotask API version 1.6


I am still developing this client.

The client will not be a light client. Instead, it will be more descriptive and full.
I know it's not "awesome code", but it works for me.

Additionally, every piece of code should have a test behind it.

TODO: Code examples soon to follow.

# Contributions
Anyone is welcome to contribute or submit a PR.

# Thank you.

Many thanks to a couple of people from whom I've shameless stolen code ideas.
